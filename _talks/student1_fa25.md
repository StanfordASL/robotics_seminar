title: "General Compliant Robot Interaction Through Scalable F/T Sensing"
abstract: "Robots excel at avoiding contact and performing structured tasks, but they often fail in unstructured, contact-rich environments. To interact safely and effectively, they must sense and regulate contact through compliance and tactile sensing. This talk presents two systems; CoinFT, a coin-sized, robust, and affordable 6-axis force/torque sensor, and UMI-FT, a handheld multimodal data collection platform that combines vision and finger-level force sensing. Together, they enable scalable tactile perception and compliant robot learning, allowing robots to not only detect contact but also use it, bringing us closer to general, contact-aware robot interaction with the real world."
