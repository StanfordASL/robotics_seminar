title: Autonomous Scheduling of Agile Spacecraft Constellations for Rapid Response Imaging
abstract: "Distributed Spacecraft, such as formation flight and constellations, are being recognized as important Earth Observation solutions to increase measurement samples over multiple spatio-temporal-angular vantage points. Small spacecraft have the capability to host imager payloads and can slew to capture images within short notice, given the precise attitude control systems emerging in the commercial market. When combined with appropriate software, this can significantly increase response rate, revisit time and coverage. We have demonstrated a ground-based, algorithmic framework that combines orbital mechanics, attitude control and scheduling optimization to plan the time-varying, full-body orientation of agile, small spacecraft in a constellation, such that they maximize observations for given imaging requirements and spacecraft specifications. Running the algorithm onboard will enable the constellation to make time-sensitive, measurement decisions autonomously. Upcoming technologies such as inter-satellite links, onboard processing of images for intelligent decision making and onboard orbit prediction will be leveraged for reaching consensus and coordinated execution among multiple spacecraft."
