title: "Learning to control large teams of robots"
abstract: "Controlling large teams of robots is a crucial challenge in robotics, due to the need for solutions that balance efficiency, scalability, and robustness. This talk will delve into recent advancements in learning-based control for multi-robot systems, with a focus on scalable coordination and decentralized decision-making. I will present the latest results we have achieved to efficiently learn distributed control strategies for large teams of robots, leveraging physics-informed machine learning and generative AI techniques. We will see how physics-informed learning can be used to provide the learned controllers three key properties: interpretability, modularity, and scalability. Similarly, we will demonstrate how generative AI can be used to ease interaction with non-expert users to describe desired large-scale swarm configurations, producing smooth trajectories and accounting for potential collisions through a reactive navigation algorithm."
