title: Planning for Contact
abstract: "Contact interactions are pervasive in many key real-world robotic tasks like manipulation and walking. However, the dynamics associated with impacts and friction remain challenging to model, and motion planning and control algorithms that can effectively reason about contact remain elusive. In this talk I will share some recent work that leverages ideas from discrete mechanics to both accurately simulate rigid body dynamics with contact, as well as enable fully contact-implicit trajectory optimization. I will share several examples in which walking gates are generated for complex robots with no a priori specification of contact mode sequences."
