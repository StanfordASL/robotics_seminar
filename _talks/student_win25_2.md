title: "Space Autonomy Through the Lens of Foundation Models"
abstract: "Recent advances across multiple research fields are rapidly changing the way in which we develop autonomous systems. In this talk, I will discuss how space autonomy can benefit from the rise of foundation models. The discussion will focus on two perspectives. First, I will discuss how techniques that are traditional to the foundation model literature can be adapted for the purpose of reliable decision-making in space, with a focus on the application of Transformers for spacecraft trajectory optimization. Next, I will discuss the opportunities presented by pre-trained foundation models within future machine learning-based autonomy stacks for space applications, ranging from data curation to serving as reconfigurable automated reasoning modules within modular autonomy stacks, towards the goal of developing a broadly capable Space Foundation Model."
