title: "Towards Rapid Design of Dexterous and Agile Robotic Behavior"
abstract: "In recent years, large language and vision models have demonstrated unprecedented "common sense" understanding. However, reliable execution of sensorimotor skills (e.g., locomotion, opening doors, object manipulation, etc.) in the open world remains elusive. I will discuss a framework for learning new, complex, and generalizable sensorimotor skills in a manner that reduces human effort and is easily scaled to many tasks. I will elaborate using the following case studies:
(i) a dexterous manipulation system capable of re-orienting novel objects of complex shapes and peeling vegetables.
(ii) a quadruped robot capable of fast locomotion, manipulation, and whole-body control on diverse natural terrains.
(iii) a lifelong learning robotic agent that can request and learn new rigid-object manipulation skills in a few minutes. 
Furthermore, I will discuss some algorithmic ideas aimed at (partially) mitigating human effort in reward design, hyper-parameter tuning and enabling seamless combination of learning signals from demonstrations, rewards, and the agent's self-exploration."
