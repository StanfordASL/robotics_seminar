title: "On human-machine interaction games"
abstract: "Our work is broadly motivated by the emergence of learning-based methods in control theory and robotics, with a specific focus on scenarios that have humans in-the-loop with control systems. For instance, learning algorithms are being deployed in semi-autonomous vehicles, robot assistants, brain-machine interfaces, and exoskeletons, where they interact dynamically with a human partner to complete tasks. When learning algorithms are employed in this way, a dynamic game is created that is played between two intelligent agents (the human and machine learners), requiring new techniques to guarantee safety and performance."
