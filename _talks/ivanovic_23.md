title: "Architecting Next-Generation AV Autonomy Stacks"
abstract: "Learning-based components are ubiquitous within modern robotic autonomy stacks. However, many of these components are not being utilized to their fullest potential, with training and evaluation schemes that are agnostic to their eventual downstream tasks. In this talk, I will present next-generation autonomy stack architectures that treat learning and differentiability as first-class citizens, enabling training and evaluation with respect to downstream tasks without sacrificing interpretability, as well as methods for evaluating and generalizing them. Towards this end, I will present some of our recent research efforts, broadly spanning the topics of information representation and uncertainty propagation, simulation, and domain generalization."
