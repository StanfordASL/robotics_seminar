title: "Designing Origami Voxels for Robotics"
abstract: "The topic of this talk is designing novel origami voxels and their applications in robotics. Just as folding a flat sheet of origami paper creates a multitude of emergent properties, we extend these principles to the design and folding of three-dimensional cubes. We focus on designing origami voxels with specific mechanical properties relevant to robotics applications, including multistability, self-locking, reconfigurability, modularity, and underactuation. The highly coupled nature of folding origami cubes contributes to addressing fundamental challenges of actuation complexity and energetic stability in modular robotics, with the goal of combining mathematical elegance and creative design with practical functionality. The talk will explore the crease patterns of eight different origami voxels with a hands-on approach, and discuss both theoretical and experimental methods of characterizing these designs for shape changing robots."
