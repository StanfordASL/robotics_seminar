title: Sub-sampling approaches to mapping and imaging
abstract: "Sub-sampling approaches can greatly reduce the amount of data that need to be gathered and stored when exploring an unknown signal or environment. When combined with optimization algorithms, accurate reconstructions from the sub-sampled data can be generated, even when acquiring far less than Nyquist-Shannon theory requires. In this talk we explore the use of such schemes in two disparate application domains. The first is in robotic mapping where sub-sampling followed by reconstruction can greatly reduce the number of measurements needed to produce accurate maps. The second is in nanometer-scale imaging using an atomic force microscope where sub-sampling can significantly increase the imaging rate for a given image resolution."
