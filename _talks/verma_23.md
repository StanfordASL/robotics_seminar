title: "Autonomous NASA robots breaking records on Mars"
abstract: "The goal of NASA’s robotics missions is to maximize science return. As instructions can only be sent once every one or more Martian solar days, robots need to be autonomous to be effective. In this seminar I’ll discuss autonomous navigation, flight, sampling and targeting data from the Mars 2020 mission which consists of the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter. The goal of the mission is to core and store Martian samples for eventual return to Earth. Perseverance’s manipulation and sampling systems have collected samples from unique locations at twice the rate of any prior mission and broken several planetary rover driving records. 88% of all driving has been autonomous - an order of magnitude more than any prior NASA Mars rover. Perseverance can autonomously select scientifically interesting rocks to shoot with its laser for analysis and is in the process of deploying autonomous planning and scheduling of activities. I’ll discuss some open problems that if addressed could further enhance space robotics at NASA JPL."
