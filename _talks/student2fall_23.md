title: "Dynamic Modeling of Vine Robots"
abstract: "Soft robots, constructed from inherently compliant materials such as fabric or silicone, have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their compliance enables them to navigate complex and cluttered environments to reach spaces that are inaccessible to traditional rigid robots. One category of soft robots, vine robots, can even grow to increase their length by orders of magnitudes. Because of this growth feature, vine robots have shown promise for applications ranging from debris inspection to surgical procedures. If we can increase our fundamental understanding of how these robots move through space, we can further expand their applications, improve the performance of their current uses, and expedite their standard design cycle. To this end, I created a dynamic model to simulate how these robots respond to force inputs to aid in the design of actuators to achieve desired vine robot behaviors."
