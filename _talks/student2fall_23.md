title: "Getting a (Gecko) Grip: Surface conformation for dry adhesion assisted robotic grasping"
abstract: "Nature continues to stimulate engineering solutions for real world problems; understanding how the gecko, for example, relies on Van Der Waals forces to climb various surfaces inevitably led to the fabrication of materials which employ the same working principles. This talk addresses the question of how to develop gecko adhesive controllability with intermittently-active surface confirmation, for utilization in real world robotic applications. A study is performed on direct indenting as a manufacturing technique for creating varying micro-geometries for aiding gecko adhesive control and conformation. Building off this capability, augmented suction and adhesion tool for side-picking bulky and irregular objects is developed with air-promoted contact. There will be reference to manufacturing requirements of the dry adhesive material, and implementation considerations for tackling and improving robotic task execution. This work informs future design and use of gecko inspired adhesives with active surface conformation as a tool to effectively solve real world challenges."
