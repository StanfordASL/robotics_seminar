title: "Design, Synthesis, Control, and Tracking of Soft Magnetic Microrobots for Targeted Therapeutic Delivery"
abstract: "Effective delivery of therapeutics remains a central challenge in medicine, particularly when interventions must navigate complex and dynamic biological environments. Magnetic microrobots offer a promising solution, providing untethered locomotion and the ability to actively steer toward target sites. Among actuation strategies, rotational magnetic fields provide scalable torque-based propulsion, enabling continuous motion and agile navigation even under physiologically relevant flow conditions. In this presentation, I will highlight two complementary microrobotic platforms. Biohybrid microrobots based on bacteria combine autonomous chemotactic sensing with external torque-based control, allowing them to navigate tissues while maintaining responsiveness to applied magnetic fields. Synthetic bioinspired microrobots, constructed from biodegradable hydrogels with anisotropic magnetic nanoparticle patterns, exploit torque-driven propulsion to achieve efficient transport and directional control in vascular models and other constrained environments. To further improve targeting, I will introduce a strategy for spatially restricting rotating magnetic fields, focusing torque delivery to specific regions to enhance precision and reduce off-target effects. Complementing this, we integrate inductive feedback for real-time tracking, capturing magnetic phase lag and swarm synchronization to enable closed-loop control of microrobotic motion and collective behavior. Together, these advances—from torque-driven actuation and programmable magnetic design to spatially focused control and real-time feedback—demonstrate a versatile, scalable approach for microscale robotic systems in targeted therapeutics, paving the way toward clinical translation."
