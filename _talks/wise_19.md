title: Taking robots to the cloud and other insights on the path to market
abstract: "The robotics industry has come a long way from the industrial robots that have long been in manufacturing environments. Now, robots that can safely work alongside people are used in all sorts of work environments. A new generation of robotics technology is emerging that brings to factory floors and warehouses the kind of speed, agility and incremental cost advantages that cloud computing has brought to IT. Collaborative, autonomous and cloud-based robotics systems donâ€™t require changes to the facility, nor do they require installation or integration of IT hardware and software. Fetch Robotics CEO Melonee Wise will discuss the evolution of robotics to the cloud, and how the company has successfully brought its robotics technology to market."
