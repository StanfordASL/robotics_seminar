title: "The Age of Human-Robot Collaboration: OceanOne<sup>K</sup> Deep-Sea Exploration"
abstract: "Robotics is undergoing a major transformation in scope and dimension with accelerating impact on the economy, production, and culture of our global society. The generations of robots now being developed will increasingly touch people and their lives. Combining the experience and cognitive abilities of the human with the strength, dependability, reach, and endurance of robots will fuel a wide range of new robotic applications. This paradigm is illustrated here with challenging underwater tasks accomplished by a robotic diver, OceanOneK. The robotâ€™s advanced autonomous capabilities for physical interaction in deep-sea are connected to a human expert through an intuitive haptic/stereo-vision interface. The robot was recently deployed in several archeological expeditions in the Mediterranean with the ability to reach 1000 meters. Distancing humans physically from dangerous and unreachable spaces while connecting their skills, intuition, and experience to the task promises to fundamentally alter remote work. These developments show how human-robot collaboration-induced synergy can expand our abilities to reach new resources, build and maintain infrastructure, and perform disaster prevention and recovery operations - be it deep in oceans and mines, at mountain tops, or in space."
