title: "ML Recipes for Building a Scalable Autonomous Driving Agent"
abstract: "Machine learning has proven to be a key ingredient in building a performant and scalable Autonomous Vehicle stack, spanning key capabilities such as perception, behavior prediction, planning and simulation. In this talk, I will describe recent Waymo research on performant ML models and architectures that help us handle the variety and complexity of the real world driving environment, and I will outline key remaining research challenges in our domain."
