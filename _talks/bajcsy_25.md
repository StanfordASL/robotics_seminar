title: "Towards Open World Robot Safety"
abstract: "Robot safety is a nuanced concept. We commonly equate safety with collision-avoidance, but in complex, real-world environments (i.e., the “open world’’) it can be much more: for example, a mobile manipulator should understand when it is not confident about a requested task, that areas roped off by caution tape should never be breached, and that objects should be gently pulled from clutter to prevent falling. However, designing robots that have such a nuanced safety understanding---and can reliably generate appropriate actions---is an outstanding challenge. In this talk, I will describe my group’s work on systematically uniting modern machine learning models (such as large vision-language models and latent world models) with classical formulations of safety in the control literature to generalize safe robot decision-making to increasingly open world interactions. Throughout the talk, I will present experimental instantiations of these ideas in domains like vision-based navigation and robotic manipulation."
