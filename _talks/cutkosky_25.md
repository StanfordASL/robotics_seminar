title: "ReachBot: Locomotion and Manipulation with Exceptional Reach"
abstract: "ReachBot is a joint project between Stanford and NASA to explore a new approach to mobility in challenging environments such as martian caves. It consists of a compact robot body with very long extending arms, based on booms used for extendable antennas. The booms unroll from a coil and can extend many meters in low gravity. In rocky environments the booms are equipped with low-mass grippers that use spines for a secure grasp. The booms are strong in tension but vulnerable to buckling in compression or bending. Motion planning with ReachBot therefore has similarities to multifingered grasp planing -- instead of fingers that push, we have booms that pull. Given its very long reach, ReachBot has a large dexterous workspace that simplifies motion planning. However, the sequence of poses must also consider what happens if any grasp fails. In this talk I will introduce the ReachBot design and motion planning considerations, report on a field test with a single ReachBot arm in a lava tube in the Mojave Desert, and discuss future plans, which include the possibility of mounting one or more ReachBot arms equipped with wrists and grippers on a mobile platform â€“ such as ANYMal.
