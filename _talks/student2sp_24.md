title: "Wearing a VR Headset While Driving to Improve Vehicle Safety"
abstract: "Driver assistance systems hold the promise of improving safety on the road. We are particularly interested in developing new assistance systems that smoothly share control with the driver and testing them in a wide range of driving conditions. Given the central role of the driver in a shared control system, it is critical to elicit natural driving behavior during tests. This talk discusses the development of a flexible driving simulation platform that can be used for safe and immersive shared control testing. Our platform, known as \"Vehicle-in-the-Loop\", enables experiments on a real vehicle within a simulated traffic scenario viewed by the driver in a virtual reality headset. By implementing this platform around a four-wheel steer-by-wire vehicle, the driver can interact with shared control systems in a variety of test conditions – including low friction and highway speed driving – all on one vehicle platform and at one proving ground."
