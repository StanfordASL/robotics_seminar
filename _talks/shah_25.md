title: "Evaluating and Improving Steerability of Generalist Robot Policies"
abstract: "General-purpose robot policies hold immense promise, yet they often struggle to generalize to novel scenarios, particularly struggling with grounding language in the physical world. In this talk, I will first propose a systematic taxonomy of robot generalization, providing a framework for understanding and evaluating current state-of-the-art generalist policies. This taxonomy highlights key limitations and areas for improvement. I will then discuss a simple idea for improving the steerability of these policies by improving language grounding in robotic manipulation and navigation. Finally, I will present our recent effort in applying these principles to scaling up generalist policy learning for dexterous manipulation."
