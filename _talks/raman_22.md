title: "Deconfliction, Or How to Keep Fleets of Fast-Flying Robots from Crashing into Each Other"
abstract: "Zipline is a California-based company that manufactures and operates national-scale medical delivery systems using fleets of small drones. Each day, Zipline's drones rack up over 70,000 km in real-world BVLOS flight: day and night, rain or shine, from remote lands to dense urban sprawl. Our vehicles can reach facilities over 80 kilometers away in under an hour - rain or shine. To date, we've made over 250,000 commercial deliveries of medical products to facilities in Rwanda, Ghana, and the United States. With over five years of continuous commercial operations and more than 30 million kilometers flown, we have built a unique perspective on scaling real-world drone operations. Our fleet of aircraft, which we call "Zips", operate fully autonomously, with minimal human supervision. On our way to achieving safe autonomous operations at scale, we have faced many technical and operational challenges we have had to innovate around. This talk describes one such innovation – our tactical deconfliction system. A constant bottleneck for our operations is: how do we safely put more Zips in the air at the same time? The design of our airspace has improved through years of iteration to support many Zips aloft at once, all autonomously avoiding one another. This talk shares details on the design of our deconfliction system, and performance data from all of our global operations."
