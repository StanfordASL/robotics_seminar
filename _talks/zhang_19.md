title: Practical Challenges of Urban Autonomous Driving
abstract: "Autonomous driving holds great promise for society in terms of improving road safety, increasing accessibility, and increasing productivity. Despite rapid technological advances in autonomous driving over the past decade, significant challenges still remain. In this talk, I will examine several practical challenges of autonomous driving in dense urban environments, with an emphasis on challenges involving human-robot interactions. I will talk about how Zoox thinks about these challenges and tackles them on multiple levels throughout the AI stack (Perception, Prediction, Planning, and Simulation). Finally, I will share my perspectives and outlook on the future of autonomous mobility."
