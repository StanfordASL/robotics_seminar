title: "Active Compliance for Robust Manipulation"
abstract: "Compliance is a physical property of motion that describes the elastic relationship brings force and motion variations. A suitable compliance profile brings robustness to robotic manipulation by handling uncertainties gracefully. In this talk, I will introduce two sets of methods for designing compliance control in manipulation tasks. I will first walk through manipulation robustness analytically, and show the role compliance control can play to improve it. With basic modeling information, the optimal control/motion plan can be computed efficiently. Then I will talk about how to learn a compliant manipulation policy directly from human demonstrations. We propose Adaptive Compliance Policy (ACP), a framework that learns to dynamically adjust system compliance both spatially and temporally for given manipulation tasks from human demonstrations."
