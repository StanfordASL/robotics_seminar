title: Fabrication via Mobile Robotics and Digital Manufacturing
abstract: "Each new generation of robotic fabrication tools has transformed manufacturing, enabling greater
complexity and customization of the world around us. With the recent developments in additive manufacturing and mobile robots, several pressing questions have emerged. How can we use computational methods to expand the set of achievable material properties? How can we use mobile robots to do manufacturing? Finally, how can we use the answers from these questions to make robots more capable?

In this talk, I will provide answers to these questions. I will demonstrate how we can use generative processes to make deformable cellular materials and how mobile manufacturing robots can perform carpentry tasks. Deformable cellular materials enable open, close, stochastic and ordered foams. These are useful in actuation, protection and deployable structures for robots. Mobile robotic fabrication brings robots out of the factory and onto the job site, enables scalable manufacturing tools, and expands the set of programmable manufacturing processes. Together these two methods will enable the next generation of custom manufacturing."
