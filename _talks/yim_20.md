title: "Challenges to Developing Low Cost Robotic Systems"
abstract: "The promise of robot systems as initially imagined in science fiction is that of generic machines capable of doing a variety of tasks often mimicking humans. It turns out doing that can be very expensive and is keeping robotic systems from having impact in today's society. One of the challenges includes overcoming the perception of the pursuit of low-cost as more than "just engineering". This talk will present some general principles towards designing low cost systems while also presenting specific examples of novel devices ranging from mechatronic components (sensors and actuators), robotic components (grippers) to full systems (flying systems). In each case we will present some practical examples of methods that can be applied today."
