title: "Autonomous, Agile, Vision-controlled Drones: from Frame-based to Event-based Vision"
abstract: "Autonomous quadrotors will soon play a major role in search-and-rescue and remote-inspection missions, where a fast response is crucial. Quadrotors have the potential to navigate quickly through unstructured environments, enter and exit buildings through narrow gaps, and fly through collapsed buildings. However, their speed and maneuverability are still far from those of birds. Indeed, agile navigation through unknown, indoor environments poses a number of challenges for robotics research in terms of perception, state estimation, planning, and control. In this talk, I will show that tightly-coupled perception and control is crucial in order to plan trajectories that improve the quality of perception. Also, I will talk about our recent results on event-based vision to enable low latency sensory motor control and navigation in both low light and dynamic environments, where traditional vision sensors fail."
