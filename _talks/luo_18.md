title: Design, Theoretical Modeling, Motion Planning , and Control of a Pressure-operated Modular Soft Robotic Snake
abstract: "Snake robotics is an important research topic with applications in a wide range of fields including inspection in confined spaces, search-and-rescue, and disaster response, where other locomotion modalities may not be ideal. Snake robots are well-suited to these applications because of their versatility and adaptability to unstructured and high-risk environments. However, compared to their biological counterparts, rigid snake robots have kinematic limitations that reduce their effectiveness in negotiating tight passageways. Pressure-operated soft robotic snakes offer a solution that can address this functionality gap. To achieve functional autonomy, this talk combines soft mobile robot modeling, control, and motion planning. We propose a pressure-operated soft robotic snake with a high degree of modularity, with embedded flexible local curvature sensing based on our recent results in this area. On this platform, we introduce the use of iterative learning control using feedback from the on-board curvature sensors to enable the snake to control its locomotion direction. We also present a motion planning and trajectory following algorithm using an adaptive bounding box, which allows for efficient motion planning that takes into account the kinematic and dynamic information of the soft robotic snake. We test this algorithm experimentally, and demonstrate its performance for obstacle avoidance scenarios."
