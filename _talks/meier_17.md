title: Continuously Learning Robots
abstract: "Most robot learning approaches are focussed on discrete, e.g. single-task, learning events. A policy is trained for specific environments and/or tasks, and then tested on similar problems. Yet, in order to be truly autonomous, robots need to be able to react to unexpected events and then update their models/policies to include the just encountered data points. In short, true autonomy requires continual learning. However, continuously updating models without forgetting previously learned mappings remains an open research problem. In this talk I will present learning algorithms, based on localized inference schemes, that alleviate the problem of forgetting when learning incrementally. Finally, I will introduce our recent advances on learning-to-learn in the context of continuous learning. We show that, with the help of our meta-learner we achieve faster model adaptation when encountering new situations when learning online."
