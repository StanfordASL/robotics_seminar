title: Safety and Efficiency in Autonomous Vehicles through Planning with Uncertainty
abstract: "In order to be useful, autonomous vehicles must accomplish goals quickly while maintaining safety and minimizing disruptions to other human activities. One key to acting efficiently in a wide range of scenarios without compromising safety is modeling and planning with uncertainty, especially uncertainty in other agents' internal states such as intentions and dispositions. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a systematic framework for dealing with this type of uncertainty, but these problems are notoriously difficult to solve. Our new online algorithms make it possible to find approximate POMDP solutions, and that the solutions are useful in autonomous driving."
