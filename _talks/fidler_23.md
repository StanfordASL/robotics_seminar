title: "A.I. for 3D Content Creation"
abstract: "3D content is key in several domains such as architecture, film, gaming, robotics, and lies in the heart of the metaverse applications. However, creating 3D content can be very time consuming -- the artists need to sculpt high quality 3d assets, compose them into large worlds, and bring these worlds to life by writing behaviour models that drive the agents around in the world. In this talk, I'll present some of our ongoing efforts on creating virtual worlds with A.I., with the focus on street level simulation for autonomous driving."
