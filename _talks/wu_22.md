title: "Multi-Sensory Neural Objects: Modeling, Inference, and Applications in Robotics"
abstract: "n the past two years, neural representations for objects and scenes have demonstrated impressive performance on graphics and vision tasks, particularly on novel view synthesis, and have gradually gained attention from the robotics community due to their potential robotic applications. In this talk, I'll present our recent efforts in building neural representations that are object-centric and multi-sensory---two properties that are essential for flexible, efficient, and generalizable robot manipulation. I'll focus on four aspects: technical innovations in building such representations, advances in scaling them up in the form of a multi-sensory neural object dataset, methods for inferring category-agnostic neural object representations and their parameters (SysID) from unlabeled visual data, and systems that adopt these representations for robotic manipulation."
