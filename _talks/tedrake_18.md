title: The Combinatorics of Multi-contact Feedback Control
abstract: "It’s sad but true: most state-of-the-art systems today for robotic manipulation operate almost completely open-loop. Shockingly, we still have essentially no principled approaches to designing feedback controllers for systems of this complexity that make and break contact with the environment. Central to the challenge is the combinatorial structure of the contact problem. In this talk, I’ll review some recent work on planning and control methods which address this combinatorial structure without sacrificing the rich underlying nonlinear dynamics. I’ll present some details of our explorations with mixed-integer convex- and SDP-relaxations applied to hard problems in legged locomotion over rough terrain, manipulation, and UAVs flying through highly cluttered environments. I’ll also show a few teasers from the dynamics and manipulation team at the Toyota Research Institute."
