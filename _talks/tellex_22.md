title: "Towards Complex Language in Partially Observed Environments"
abstract: "Robots can act as a force multiplier for people, whether a robot
assisting an astronaut with a repair on the International Space
station, a UAV taking flight over our cities, or an autonomous vehicle
driving through our streets. Existing approaches use action-based
representations that do not capture the goal-based meaning of a
language expression and do not generalize to partially observed
environments.  The aim of my research program is to create autonomous
robots that can understand complex goal-based commands and execute
those commands in partially observed, dynamic environments.  I will
describe demonstrations of object-search in a POMDP setting with
information about object locations provided by language, and mapping
between English and Linear Temporal Logic, enabling a robot to
understand complex natural language commands in city-scale
environments.  These advances represent steps towards robots that
interpret complex natural language commands in partially observed
environments using a decision theoretic framework."
