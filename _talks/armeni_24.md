title: "Living Scenes: Creating and updating 3D representations of evolving indoor scenes"
abstract: "Buildings are like living organisms, i.e., they evolve over time due to interaction with natural phenomena and humans. How can we realistically maintain their digital twins throughout their lifespan? Or else, how can we maintain a living building model as the space is undergoing changes? In this talk, I will present some of my recent works that focus on creating and updating building replicas of geometry and semantics using visual data that depict the building undergoing changes over time as a result of human interaction. I will discuss handling both drastic changes in the building during construction and smaller changes on asset location and geometry during operation, while ensuring privacy and realistic implementations. The goal of this research line is to develop quantitative and data driven methods for better construction and operation monitoring, to ultimately create sustainable buildings that are more suitable for users."
