title: "From Digital Humans to Safe Humanoids: Grounded Reasoning and Compliant Interaction "
abstract: "Humanoid robots are entering human-centric environments, where they must not only move well but also understand people and interact safely through physical contact. In this talk, I will present two complementary directions toward human-centered embodied intelligence. First, I will introduce GentleHumanoid, a whole-body control policy that combines motion tracking with compliant, tunable force regulation, enabling contact-rich behaviors such as gentle hugging, assistive support, and safe object interaction on the Unitree G1. Second, I will show how large language models can be grounded in 3D human motion for behavior understanding and planning, highlighting ChatPose and ChatHuman as steps toward systems that interpret actions, anticipate intent, and connect high-level reasoning to executable motion. I will close with future directions on scaling human–humanoid interaction data, developing vision-language-action models for long-horizon interaction, and incorporating muscle-driven modeling for more realistic and adaptive humanoids. "
