title: "Toward Generalist Humanoid Robots: Recent Advances, Opportunities, and Challenges"
abstract: "In an era of rapid AI progress, leveraging accelerated computing and big data has unlocked new possibilities to develop generalist AI models. As AI systems like ChatGPT showcase remarkable performance in the digital realm, we are compelled to ask: Can we achieve similar breakthroughs in the physical world — to create generalist humanoid robots capable of performing everyday tasks? In this talk, I will outline our data-centric research principles and approaches for building general-purpose robot autonomy in the open world. I will present our recent work leveraging real-world, synthetic, and web data to train foundation models for humanoid robots. Furthermore, I will discuss the opportunities and challenges of building the next generation of intelligent robots."
