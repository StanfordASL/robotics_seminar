title: "Connecting Robotics and Foundation Models"
abstract: "Foundation models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world, but can be limited by their lack of interactive, real-world experience. This poses a challenge for leveraging them in robotics, which requires interactive decision making and reasoning for a given embodiment. This talk will discuss several research directions towards addressing these challenges, from grounding them in their environment (SayCan, InnerMonologue, Grounded Decoding, NL-Maps), to directly outputting grounded code (Code as Policies), and finally training them with embodied robotics data (PaLM-E, RT-1)."
