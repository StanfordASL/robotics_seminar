title: "From open-source to safety-certified robotic software "
abstract: "For decades, automotive and robotics developers have reinvented the software wheel many times. With its launch in 2010, ROS has enabled rapid software prototyping and reuse of software in prototyping and development. In 2018, the launch of ROS 2 further improved ROS and its architecture and ROS 2 now provides an efficient prototyping and rapid development platform. But the lack of real-time performance and safety certification still prevents the widescale adoption of ROS-based software into products in safety-critical products. 
In this talk, we will discuss the state of the art in robotics and automotive software and how we have taken ROS from an open-source project to a safety-certified robotic and automotive software development kit.
