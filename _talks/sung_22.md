title: "Computational Design of Compliant, Dynamical Robots"
abstract: "Recent years have seen a large interest in soft robotic systems, which provide new opportunities for machines that are flexible, adaptable, safe, and robust. These systems have been highly successful in a broad range of applications, including manipulation, locomotion, human-robot interaction, and more, but they present challenging design and control problems. In this talk, I will share efforts from my group to expand the capabilities of compliant and origami robots to dynamical tasks. I will show how the compliance of a mechanism can be designed to produce a particular mechanical response, how we can leverage these designs for better performance and simpler control, and how we approach these problems computationally to design new compliant robots with new capabilities such as hopping, swimming, and flight."
