title: "Large Language Models for Solving Long-Horizon Manipulation Problems"
abstract: "My long-term research goal is enable real robots to manipulate any kind of object such that they can perform many different tasks in a wide variety of application scenarios such as in our homes, in hospitals, warehouses, or factories. Many of these tasks will require long-horizon reasoning and sequencing of skills to achieve a goal state. In this talk, I will present our work on enabling long-horizon reasoning on real robots for a variety of different long-horizon tasks that can be solved by sequencing a large variety of composable skill primitives. I will specifically focus on the different ways Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with solving these long-horizon tasks. The first part of my talk will be on TidyBot, a robot for personalised household clean-up. One of the key challenges in robotic household cleanup is deciding where each item goes. People's preferences can vary greatly depending on personal taste or cultural background. One person might want shirts in the drawer, another might want them on the shelf. How can we infer these user preferences from only a handful of examples in a generalizable way? Our key insight: Summarization with LLMs is an effective way to achieve generalization in robotics. Given the generalised rules, I will then show how TidyBot then solves the long-horizon task of cleaning up a home. In the second part of my talk, I will focus on more complex long-horizon manipulation tasks that exhibit geometric dependencies between different skills in a sequence. In these tasks, the way a robot performs a certain skill will determine whether a follow-up skill in the sequence can be executed at all. I will present an approach called text2motion that utilises LLMs for task planning without the need for defining complex symbolic domains. And I will show how we can verify whether the plan that the LLM came up with is actually feasible. The basis for this verification is a library of learned skills and an approach for sequencing these skills to resolve geometric dependencies prevalent in long-horizon tasks."
