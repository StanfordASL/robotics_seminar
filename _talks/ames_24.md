title: "Safe Autonomy: Why Learning Needs Control"
abstract: "As robotic systems pervade our everyday lives, especially those that leverage complex learning and autonomy algorithms, the question becomes: how can we trust that robots will operate safely around us? An answer to this question was given, in the abstract, by famed science fiction writer Isaac Asimov: The Three Laws of Robotics. These laws provide a safety layer between the robot and the world that ensures trustworthy behavior. In this presentation, I will propose a mathematical formalization of the three laws of robots, encapsulated by control barrier functions (CBFs). These generalizations of (control) Lyapunov functions ensure forward invariance of “safe” sets. Moreover, CBFs lead to the notion of a safety filter that minimally modifies an existing controller to ensure the safety of the system—even if this controller is unknown, the result of a learning-based process, or operating as part of a broader layered autonomy stack. The utility of CBFs will be demonstrated through their extensive implementation in practice on a wide variety of highly dynamic robotic systems: from ground robots, to drones, to legged robots, to robotic assistive devices."
