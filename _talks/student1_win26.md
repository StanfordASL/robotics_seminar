title: "Autonomous Navigation in Complex Outdoor Environments: Towards Companion Robots for Longevity"
abstract: "Deploying mobile robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a fundamental challenge, requiring the ability to robustly perceive complex terrains, pedestrian flows, and general traffic rules. To effectively serve humans, especially older adults, these robots must go beyond simple navigation to also understand human behavior and enhance personal mobility. In this talk, I will review our previous approaches for long-range outdoor navigation, with a focus on scene understanding and planning. Then, I will present a high-level overview of what we are currently working on, where I aim to apply these navigation technologies to develop companion robots that support older adults."
