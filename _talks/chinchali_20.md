title: Distributed Perception and Learning Between Robots and the Cloud
abstract: "Today’s robotic fleets are increasingly facing two coupled challenges. First, they are measuring growing volumes of high-bitrate video and LIDAR sensory streams, which, second, requires them to use increasingly compute-intensive models, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), for downstream perception or control. To cope with such challenges, compute and storage-limited robots, such as low-power drones, can offload data to central servers (or “the cloud”), for more accurate real-time perception as well as offline model learning. However, cloud processing of robotic sensory streams introduces acute systems bottlenecks ranging from  network delay for real-time inference, to cloud storage, human annotation, and cloud-computing cost for offline model learning. 


In this talk, I will present learning-based approaches for robots to improve model performance with cloud offloading, but with minimal systems cost. For real-time inference, I will present a deep reinforcement learning based offloader that decides when a robot should exploit low-latency, on-board computation, or, when highly uncertain, query a more accurate cloud model. Then, for continual learning, I will present an intelligent, on-robot sampler that mines real-time sensory streams for valuable training examples to send to the cloud for model re-training. Using insights from months of field data and experiments on state-of-the-art embedded deep learning hardware, I will show how simple learning algorithms allow robots to significantly transcend their on-board sensing and control performance, but with limited communication cost."
