title: "Recent advances in surgical robotics: some examples through the LIRMM research activities illustrated in minimally invasive surgery and interventional radiology"
abstract: "The interest of surgeons for robotics grew a lot since the last two decades. The presence of the DaVinci robot in the operating room opens a large road for the use of robotized instruments in the OR. Discussing some recent advances in surgical robotics, we will highlight some new trends by presenting some examples of the LIRMM research activities. It will be illustrated in the domain of minimally invasive surgery and interventional radiology."
