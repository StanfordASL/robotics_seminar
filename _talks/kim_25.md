title: " Physical Intelligence and Cognitive Biases Toward AI"
abstract: "When will robots be able to clean my house, dishes, and take care of laundry? While we source labor primarily from automated machines in factories, the penetration of physical robots in our daily lives has been slow. What are the challenges in realizing these intelligent machines capable of human level skill? Isnâ€™t AI advanced enough to replace many skills of humans? Unlike conventional robots, which are optimized mainly for position control with almost no adaptability, household tasks require a kind of 'physical intelligence' that involves complex dynamic interactions with overwhelming uncertainties. While advanced language models exemplify AI's prowess in data organization and text generation, a significant divide exists between AI for virtual and physical applications. In this conversation, we'll delve into the cognitive biases that often lead us to underestimate this technological gap. "
