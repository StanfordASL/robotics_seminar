title: "Hopping Rovers for Exploration of Asteroids and Comets: Design, Control, and Autonomy"
abstract: "The surface exploration of small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids and comets, has become a central objective for NASA and space agencies worldwide. However, the highly irregular terrain and extremely weak gravity on small bodies present major challenges for traditional wheeled rovers, such as those sent to the moon and Mars. Through a joint collaboration between Stanford and JPL, we have been developing a minimalistic internally-actuated hopping rover called “Hedgehog” for targeted mobility in these extreme environments. By applying controlled torques to three internal flywheels, Hedgehog can perform various controlled maneuvers including long-range hops and short, precise “tumbles.” In this talk, I will present my PhD work on developing the necessary tools to make such a hopping system controllable and autonomous, ranging from low-level dynamics modeling and control analysis to higher-level motion planning for highly stochastic hopping/bouncing dynamics."
