title: "Paradigm shift of haptic human-machine interaction: Historical perspective and our practice"
abstract: "Haptics is a fundamental channel when we interact with the physical world. However, it is underutilized when human interact with machines such as computers and robots. In this talk, I will start from the biological motivation of studying haptic human-machine interaction (HMI), and then I will introduce the paradigm shift of haptic MRI in the past 30 years, which include desktop haptics in personal computer era, surface haptics in mobile computer era, and wearable haptics in virtual reality era. Specifically I will try to keep a balance on the research performed in our group and in the whole haptics community. Finally I will share my perspective on future research challenges in haptics HMI field."
