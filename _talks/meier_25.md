title: "Towards robots that generalize and adapt efficiently"
abstract: "While there has been major investment in developing large-scale robot learning algorithms, achieving true autonomy remains a wide-open research question. A key ingredient towards this goal is a robots ability to generalize to unseen scenarios well enough such that it can bootstrap learning and adaptation efficiently. In this talk, Iâ€™ll present examples of FAIR robotics research towards the goal of learning general representations for a wide spectrum of robotics applications."
