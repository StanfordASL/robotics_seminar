title: Motion planning of bipedal robots based on Divergent Component of Motion
abstract: "Honda has been developing bipedal humanoid robots for more than 30 years. As a part of the results, we showed several locomotion ability of humanoid robot such as robust walking, running, jumping and quadrupedal walking. A key concept of these abilities is divergent component of motion (DCM). DCM is a component of robot's center of gravity and must be controlled properly because of its divergent property. We derived it from eigenvalue decomposition, but equivalent values have proposed by other researchers independently. In this talk, I will give the definition and property of DCM and show its application methods for robot's locomotion."
