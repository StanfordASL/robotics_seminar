title: "Adaptive robots through reconfiguration, compliance, and contact"
abstract: "Recent advances in robot materials and algorithms have enabled new levels of adaptive and versatile behavior. In this talk I will describe my lab’s efforts to create robots capable of emergent adaptive behaviors. I will first describe how soft materials can enable reconfigurable robot appendages and bodies, culminating in new modes of robot manipulation and locomotion. Next, I will describe how autonomous oscillators drive adaptive flapping wing robots and have shed new light on the evolution of insect flight. Lastly, I will describe how mechanical contact can be leveraged for multi-robot control such as friction modulation or multi-robot synchronization. The overarching focus of this work is to identify opportunities for adaptive behavior in robots from engineered emergent phenomena.  "
