title: "Resilient Autonomy for Extreme and Uncertain Environments"
abstract: "Robots show great promise if they can get out of the lab into the field and go beyond a single-operator per robot paradigm. However, the unstructured nature of the real-world requires nuanced decision making of the robot. In this talk I will outline some of our approaches, progress, and results on multi-modal sensing, providing nuanced perception inputs, as well as navigation in difficult terrain, and future directions of our research."
