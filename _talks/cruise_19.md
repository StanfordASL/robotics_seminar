title: "Scaled Learning for Autonomous Vehicles"
abstract: "The adoption of machine learning to solve problems in autonomous systems has become increasingly prevalent. Cruise is a developer of self-driving cars, currently operating a research and development fleet of over 100 all-electric autonomous vehicles in San Francisco. In this talk, we focus on the challenges involved with developing machine learning solutions in the autonomous driving domain. In addition to sharing lessons learned over the past few years of autonomous vehicle development, this discussion will include a review of some of the more challenging perception and prediction problems faced when operating driverless vehicles on the chaotic streets of San Francisco. Then, we share and highlight what it takes to make machine learning work in the wilderness at scale to meet these challenges."
