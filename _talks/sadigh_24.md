title: "Robot Learning in the Era of Large Pretrained Models"
abstract: "In this talk, I will discuss how interactive robot learning can benefit from the rise of large pretrained models such as foundation models. I will introduce two perspectives. First I will discuss the role of pretraining when learning visual representations, and how language can guide learning grounded visual representations useful for downstream robotics tasks. I will then discuss the choice of datasets during pretraining. Specifically, how we could guide large scale data collection, and what constitutes high quality data for imitation learning. I will discuss some recent work around guiding data collection based on enabling compositional generalization of learned policies. Finally, I will end the talk by discussing a few creative ways of tapping into the rich context of large language models and vision-language models for robotics."
