title: "Scalable Unified Perception for Autonomous Vehicles: Enhancing Efficiency and Cross-Platform Adaptability"
abstract: "In the rapidly advancing realm of autonomous driving, developing and deploying efficient and scalable perception models across vehicle platforms is crucial. This presentation introduces a Unified Perception Model crafted to manage the diverse array of perception tasks essential for autonomous vehicles, such as object detection and occupancy estimation, within a single, integrated framework. While there are many topics around the Unified Perception Model, we will focus on the efficiency and scalability of the model. In particular, you will find answers to the following two questions: 1) How can we leverage temporal information without sacrificing training efficiency and model capacity? 2) How to do large scale cross-platform pretraining and cross-platform deployment? Our unified model aims to streamline operations, reduce complexity, and enhance adaptability across diverse autonomous driving platforms, marking a significant advance in the development of autonomous vehicle technology."
