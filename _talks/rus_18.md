title: Recent Advances Enabling Autonomous Transportation
abstract: "Tomorrow's cars will be our partners. They will drastically improve the safety and quality of the driving experience. They will fill in when our human senses fail us, helping us navigate icy roads and blind intersections, paying attention when we're tired, and even making our time in the car fun. However we are not there yet. Our broad objective is to develop the science and engineering of autonomy and its broad range of application in transportation, logistics, manufacturing, and exploration. In this talk I will discuss recent advances in autonomous vehicles and mobility as a service, powered by new algorithms for perception, planning, learning, and control. These algorithms (i) understand the behavior of other agents, (ii) devise controllers for safe interactions, (iii) generate provably-safe trajectories that get the vehicle through cluttered environments in a natural manner, while guaranteeing safety, and (iv) optimize the allocation of customers to vehicles to optimize a multi-vehicle transportation system."
