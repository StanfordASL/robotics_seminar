title: Biological and Robotic haptics
abstract: "We will introduce the audience to the mechanisms underlying tactile sensing in nature and the corresponding implications for robotic tactile sensing, tactile perception and haptics. The first part of the talk will focus primarily on human mechanoreception, to provide an understanding of what we sense, how we sense it, and how we use the information in exploration and manipulation. The second part will look at robotic tactile sensing and haptic display, mainly from the standpoint of what information is desired and how to obtain it, rather than surveying the many kinds of tactile sensors developed over the years. In comparison to other sensing modalities, tactile sensing is inherently multi-modal, distributed, and the result of physical interactions with objects and surfaces. These factors are largely responsible for the slow evolution of robotic tactile sensing in comparison to vision."
