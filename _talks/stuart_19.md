title: "Hands in the Real World: Grasping Outside the Lab"
abstract: "Robots face a rapidly expanding range of potential applications beyond the lab, from remote exploration and search-and-rescue to household assistance. The focus of physical interaction is typically delegated to end-effectors, or hands, as these machines perform manual tasks. Despite decades of dedicated research, effective deployment of robot hands in the real world is still limited to a few examples, other than the use of rigid parallel-jaw grippers. In this presentation, I will review articulated hands that found application in the field, focusing primarily on ocean exploration and drawing examples from recent developments in the Embodied Dexterity Group. I will also introduce preliminary findings regarding an assistive mitten designed to improve the grasping strength of people with weakened hands. Similarities between the design of robot hands and wearable technologies for the human hand will be discussed."
