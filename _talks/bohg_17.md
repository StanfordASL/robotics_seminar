title: Combining learned and analytical models for predicting the effect of contact interaction
abstract: "One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect of physical interactions with objects in the environment. Traditionally, these dynamics have been described by physics-based analytical models which may be very hard to formulate for complex problems. More recently, we have seen learning-based approaches that can predict the effect of complex physical interactions from raw sensory input. However, it is an open question how far these models generalise beyond their training data.
In this talk, I propose a way to combine analytical and learned models to leverage the best of both worlds. The method assumes raw sensory data as input and the predicted effect as output. In our experiments, we compared the performance of the proposed model to a purely learned and a pure analytical model. Our results show that the combined method outperforms the purely learned version in terms of accuracy and generalisation to interactions and objects not seen during training. Beyond these empirical result, I will also present an in-depth analysis of why the purely learned model has difficulties in capturing the dynamics of this task and how the analytical model helps."
