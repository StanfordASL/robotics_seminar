title: Semantic Understanding for Robot Perception
abstract: "Advancements in robotic navigation and fetch and delivery tasks rest to a large extent on robust, efficient and scalable semantic understanding of the surrounding environment. Deep learning fueled rapid progress in computer vision in object category recognition, localization and semantic segmentation, exploiting large amounts of labelled data and using mostly static images. I will talk about challenges and opportunities in tackling these problems in indoors and outdoors environments relevant to robotics applications. These include methods for semantic segmentation and 3D structure recovery using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), localization and mapping of large scale environments, training object instance detectors using synthetically generated training data and 3D object pose recovery. The applicability of the techniques for autonomous driving, service robotics, augmented reality and navigation will be discussed."
