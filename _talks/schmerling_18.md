title: On Quantifying Uncertainty for Robot Planning and Decision Making
abstract: "Robot planning and control is often tailored towards the 'average' case -- we plan with a certain behavior in mind and hope that in execution a robot can achieve, or at least stay close to its plan. While this assumption may be justified for assembly robots on factory floors, in less structured settings robots must contend with uncertainty in their dynamics, sensing, and environment that can force their best laid plans awry. In this talk I will discuss two methods for quantifying uncertainty in the case that multimodality, i.e., the possibility of multiple highly distinct futures, plays a critical role in decision making. The first portion of this talk will outline a computationally efficient method for estimating the likelihood of multiple rare, but critical events (e.g., collisions with a robot's environment) under a known uncertainty model. The second portion will focus on learning multimodal generative models for human-robot interaction in an autonomous driving context where the uncertainty in human action depends reciprocally on a robot's candidate action plan."
