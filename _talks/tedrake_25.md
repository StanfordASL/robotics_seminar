title: "A Careful Examination of Multitask Transfer in TRI’s Large Behavior Models for Dexterous Manipulation"
abstract: "Many of us are collecting large scale multitask teleop demonstration data for manipulation, with the belief that it can enable rapidly deploying robots in novel applications and delivering robustness in the 'open world'. But rigorous evaluation of these models is a bottleneck. In this talk, I'll describe our recent efforts at TRI to quantify some of the key 'multitask hypotheses', and some of the tools that we've built in order to make key decisions about data, architecture, and hyperparameters more quickly and with more confidence. And, of course, I’ll bring some cool robot videos."
