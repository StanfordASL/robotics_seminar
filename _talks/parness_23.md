title: "Stowing and Picking Items in E-Commerce"
abstract: "Stowing and picking items are two of the most expensive tasks in e-commerce fulfillment. They are difficult to automate because of 1) the many physical contacts between the robot and items already on shelves, 2) the variety of items that are handled, and 3) the financial motivation for storage density. This talk presents development of robotic manipulation capabilities for high clutter and high contact. Our perception algorithms infer available space using images of shelfs and manifest information. We then plan motions with an assumption of contact, and control those motions with force and torque in the loop. Custom end of arm tools (grippers) simplify the tasks."
