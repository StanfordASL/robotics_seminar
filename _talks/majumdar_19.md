title: Safety Guarantees with Perception and Learning in the Loop
abstract: "Imagine an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that successfully navigates a thousand different obstacle environments or a robotic manipulator that successfully grasps a million objects in our dataset. How likely are these systems to succeed on a novel (i.e., previously unseen) environment or object? How can we learn control policies that provably generalize well to environments or objects that our robot has not previously encountered?

In this talk, I will present approaches for learning control policies for robotic systems that provably generalize well with high probability to novel environments. The key technical idea behind our approach is to leverage tools from generalization theory (e.g., PAC-Bayes theory) in machine learning and the theory of information bottlenecks from information theory. We apply our techniques on examples including UAV navigation and grasping in order to demonstrate the ability to provide strong generalization guarantees on controllers for robotic systems with continuous state and action spaces, complicated (e.g., nonlinear) dynamics, and rich sensory inputs (e.g., depth measurements)."
