title: "Crossing the Reality Gap: Coordinating Multirobot Systems in The Physical World"
abstract: "Using a group of robots in place of a single robot to accomplish a complex task has many benefits such as redundancy, robustness, faster completion times, and the ability to be everywhere at once. The applications of such systems are wide and varied: Imagine teams of robots containing forest fires, filling urban skies with package deliveries, or searching for survivors after a natural disaster. These applications have been motivating multirobot research for years, but why arenâ€™t they happening yet? These missions demand different roles for robots, necessitating a strategy for coordinated autonomy while respecting any constraints the particular environment or other team members may impose. As a result, current solutions for multirobot systems are often task- and environment-specific, requiring hand-tuning and an expert in the loop. They also require solutions that can manage complexity as the number of robots increases. Such inflexibility in deployment, reduced situational awareness, computational complexity, and need for multiple operators significantly limits widespread use of multirobot systems

In this talk I will present algorithmic strategies that address the main challenges that precludes the widespread adoption of multirobot systems. In particular, I will focus on strategies we have developed that automatically synthesize policies that are broadly applicable to navigating groups of robots in complex environment, from nearly real-time solutions for coordinating hundreds of robots to real-time collision avoidance. I will conclude with experimental results that validate our strategies using our CrazySwarm testbed -- a 49-UAV platform for testing multi-robot algorithms at a large scale."
