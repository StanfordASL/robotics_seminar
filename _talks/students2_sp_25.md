title: "Robot Learning Without Action Chunking"
abstract: "Recent advances in robot learning have mirrored the progress of large language models in many waysâ€”yet, one key distinction remains: action chunking. In this talk, I will begin with an analysis of action chunking, highlighting its inherent tradeoff between long-term consistency and short-term reactivity. I will then introduce two methods to address this tradeoff: (i) Bidirectional Decoding: an inference algorithm that jointly optimizes consistency and reactivity using additional compute at test time; (ii) Past-Token Prediction: an auxiliary training objective that encourages diffusion policies to capture temporal dependencies in long-context observations. Together, these methods offer a promising path toward memory-aware robot policies without action chunking."
