title: 	Designing exoskeletons and prostheses that enhance human performance
abstract: "Exoskeletons and active prostheses could improve mobility for hundreds of millions of people. However, two serious challenges must first be overcome: we need ways of identifying what a device should do to benefit an individual user, and we need cheap, efficient hardware that can do it. In this talk, we will describe a new approach to the design of wearable robots, based on versatile emulator systems and algorithms that automatically customize assistance, which we call human-in-the-loop optimization. We will also discuss the design of exoskeletons that use no energy themselves, yet reduce the energy cost of human walking, and efficient, electroadhesive actuators that could make wearable robots substantially cheaper and more efficient."
