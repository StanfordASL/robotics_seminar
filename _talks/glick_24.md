title: "Embodied Intelligence for Extreme Environments"
abstract: "Extreme environments penalize the sensing, actuation, computation, and communication that robotic systems rely upon. Compounding this challenge is the fact that these remote locations are often some of the least mapped areas on and beyond our planet. Structured compliance offers a pathway for robots to adapt to their environment at the mechanical level while preserving the strength to support payload mass & forceful interactions. This theme is explored across projects that include gripping in space, exploration of coral reefs, data acquisition under ice, and a cold-operable robotic arm. "
