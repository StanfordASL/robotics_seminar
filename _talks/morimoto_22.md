title: "Flexible Surgical Robots: Design, Sensing, and Control"
abstract: "Flexible and soft medical robots offer capabilities beyond those of conventional rigid-link robots due to their ability to traverse confined spaces and conform to highly curved paths. They also offer potential for improved safety due to their inherent compliance. In this talk, I will present several new robot designs for various surgical applications. In particular, I will discuss our work on soft, growing robots that achieve locomotion by material extending from their tip. I will discuss limitations in miniaturizing such robots, along with methods for actively steering, sensing, and controlling them. Finally, I will also discuss new approaches for sensing, haptic feedback, and human-in-the-loop control that are aimed at improving the performance of flexible surgical robots."
