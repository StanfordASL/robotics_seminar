title: "Designing More Effective Remote Presence Systems for Human Connection and Exploration"
abstract: "As people are speculating about what the future of robots in the workplace will look like, this could be a good time to realize that we already live in that future. We actually know a lot about what it’s like to telecommute to work everyday via telepresence robot. Coming from a human-robot interaction perspective, I’ll present the research lessons learned from several years of fielding telepresence robot prototypes in companies and running controlled experiments in the lab to figure out how to better support remote collaboration between people. Building upon that work, I will share some recent research on professional robot operators, including service robot operators, drone pilots, and deep sea robot operators. Finally, I will share our current research on identifying needs and opportunities for designing robotic systems that can better support robotic systems with humans in-the-loop."
