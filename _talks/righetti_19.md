title: Fast computation of robust multi-contact behaviors
abstract: "Interaction with objects and environments is at the core of any manipulation or locomotion behavior, yet, robots still mostly try to avoid physical interaction with their environment at all costs. This is in stark contrast with humans or animals, that not only constantly interact with their environment from the day they are born but also exploit this interaction to improve their skills. One reason that prevents robots from seamlessly interacting with the world is that reasoning about contacts is a computationally daunting problem. In this presentation, I will present our efforts to break down this complexity and find algorithms that are computationally efficient yet generic enough to be applied to any robot. I will also discuss how these approaches can be rendered robust to unknown and changing environments and how we can leverage machine learning to significantly improve computation efficiency."
