title: Self-Supervision for Robotic Learning
abstract: "One of the main challenges in applying machine learning techniques to robotics problem is the problem of acquiring labeled data. This is particularly important for anything involving perception, where deep learning techniques perform very well in high-data, supervised regimes, but degrade quickly in performance when data-starved. In this talk I'll argue that thanks to the intrinsic multi-modal and dynamical nature of many robotics problems, much of that gap can be filled using self-supervision, using either alternative modalities or temporal prediction as the supervisory signal. I'll examine how self-consistency, both at the geometric and semantic level, can provide a powerful signal to leverage in teaching robots how to interpret and act in the world."
