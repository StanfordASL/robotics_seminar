title: "Make Every Step an Experiment: Towards Terrain-aware, High-mobility Robots for Planetary Explorations"
abstract: "In this talk, I will present our recent progress in two main directions. First, I will show that by strategically eliciting the force responses from loose regolith, robots could generate desired ground reaction forces and achieve substantially improved locomotion performance on deformable substrates. Second, I will show that by leveraging the high force transparency of direct-drive actuators, robots can use their legs as proprioceptive sensors to opportunistically determine the terramechanical properties of regolith from every step."
