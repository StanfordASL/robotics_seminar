title: "Embodied Foundation Models: Bridging RL Locomotion and LLMs for Legged Navigation"
abstract: "Quadrupedal robots trained with reinforcement learning (RL) can navigate rough and challenging environments without falling, yet they remain far from fully autonomous and fail to achieve general-purpose navigation. Consequently, current systems heavily rely on teleoperation, which limits their practical utility. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have acquired broad world knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this talk, we review what makes sim-to-real work for locomotion and why it remains limited for manipulation, examine the systemic challenges of integrating RL with reasoning models, and showcase recent work bridging the simulation diversity gap. We also evaluate current LLM capabilities for enabling navigation and propose paths forward for embodied LLMs conditioned on low-level RL policies."
