title: "Law as Action: Profit-Driven Bias in Autonomous Vehicles"
abstract: "Profit maximizing firms designing autonomous vehicles will face economic incentives to weigh the benefits of delivering speedy transportation against expected liabilities in the event of an accident. This Article demonstrates that path planning algorithms optimizing these tradeoffs using well-established auto injury compensation formulas may have the unintended consequence of producing facially discriminatory driving behaviors in autonomous vehicles. It considers a simulated one-way street setting with a probabilistic pedestrian crossing and uses U.S. Census Bureau data to calculate income-based liability predictions for collision events. Obtaining quantitative results through Monte Carlo sampling, this Article shows how profit maximizing speeds can be expected to vary inversely with neighborhood income levelsâ€”putting simulated pedestrians that encounter such systems in predominantly minority regions at heightened risk of injury or death relative to their non-minority counterparts. It then discusses how these findings are consistent with a host of other recently documented instances of real world algorithmic bias that highlight the need for fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems. Finally, it surveys the challenges facing lawyers, engineers, industry leaders, and policymakers tasked with governing these systems, and argues that a multidisciplinary, multistakeholder approach is necessary to shape policy that is sensitive to the complex social realms into which AI systems are deploying."
