title: Safety in Autonomy via Reachability
abstract: "Autonomous systems are becoming pervasive in everyday life, and many of these systems are complex and safety-critical. Reachability analysis is a flexible tool for guaranteeing safety for nonlinear systems under the influence of unknown disturbances, and involves computing the reachable set, which quantifies the set of initial states from which a system may reach a set of unsafe states. However, computational scalability, a difficult challenge in formal verification, makes reachability analysis intractable for complex, high-dimensional systems. In this seminar, I will show how high-dimensional reachability analysis can be made more tractable through a clever differential game approach in the context of real-time robust planning, through carefully decomposing a complex system into subsystems, and through utilizing optimization techniques that provide conservative safety guarantees. By tackling the curse of dimensionality from multiple fronts, tractable verification of practical systems is becoming a reality, paving the way towards more pervasive and safer automation."
