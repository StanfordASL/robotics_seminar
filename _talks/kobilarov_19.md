abstract: "This talk will focus on computing robust control policies for autonomous agents performing a given task that can be modeled using a performance function and constraints. We will first consider a strategy for computing guarantees on future policy execution under uncertainty, based on probably-approximately-correct (PAC) high-confidence performance bounds. The bounds will then be used to optimize a given policy based on a high-fidelity learned stochastic model of the agent and its environment. Finally, we will consider initial efforts towards transferring such robust policies to physical agents such as aerial and ground vehicles navigating around obstacles."
