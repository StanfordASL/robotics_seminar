title: Reachability in Robotics
abstract: "Motion planning is an extremely well-studied problem in the robotics community, yet existing work largely falls into one of two categories: computationally efficient but with few if any safety guarantees, or able to give stronger guarantees but at high computational cost. In this talk I will give an overview of some of the techniques used in the Berkeley Hybrid Systems lab to balance safety with computational complexity in analyzing control systems. I will show these methods applied to a quadrotor in a motion capture room planning in real time to navigate around a priori unknown obstacles, as well as navigation around a human pedestrian."
