title: "Meet Astro: Amazon Consumer Robotics’ first robot for homes and small-to-medium businesses"
abstract: "Astro is Amazon’s first robot designed for homes and small-to-medium businesses. In this talk, we will show Astro’s use cases, including home monitoring, Human Robot Interaction, and Virtual Security Guard, and share how we designed Astro for customers. Making the first prototype work is a very different problem from designing and testing robots for mass production. Design for manufacturability, repairability, and sustainability are important tenets for making robots that are easy to assemble, test, and fix. Reliability is another critical concern for mass-produced robots, we’ll describe some of the some of the extensive testing we performed to make sure that every Astro robot works for customers for years. The Mobility and Perception capabilities of Astro are what make it useful and capable in unstructured and variable environments like homes. Our software team overcame challenges to deliver these capabilities with consumer-grade sensors and compute. We’ll conclude with some of Amazon’s programs to engage with the academic community.
