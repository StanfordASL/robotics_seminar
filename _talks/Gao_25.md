title: "Manipulation Data Pyramid: From Human Video Pretraining to Physical RL"
abstract: "Scaling laws are now often seen as a key ingredient on the path toward general intelligence. But in robotics, progress is slowed by one major obstacle: the lack of abundant, high-quality data. In this talk, I introduce a data pyramid strategy designed to tackle this challenge by making the most of diverse data sources. The idea is simple but powerful: combine internet-scale datasets, human teleoperation data, and robot-collected experiences so that each strengthens and fills in the gaps of the others."
