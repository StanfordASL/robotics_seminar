title: "The Graph Physical AI Approach: Bridging Physics and Data for Scalable Robotics"
abstract: "Autonomous robots still struggle in the field — when tasks drift from the script, materials deform, weather turns unpredictable, or unmodeled interactions arise. Across mobile robots, manipulators, and humanoids, such edge cases reveal the persistent gap between lab-trained AI and real-world reliability. While vision–language–action (VLA) models show promise in unifying perception, reasoning, and control, their reliance on massive datasets and retraining makes them fragile in dynamic, data-scarce settings. Robots cannot scale by data — they must scale by understanding. I will present Graph Physical AI (G-PAI), a foundation model that embeds physics–neural operators directly into its multimodal design, enabling data-efficient learning and robust adaptation across robot types. Its compositional architecture links perception, planning, and control agents through a shared physics-informed core, ensuring interpretability and fast generalization. G-PAI is already powering robots in demanding conditions — from warehouses and construction sites to agricultural operations. It has formal safety benchmarks on long-tail edge cases with an OEM, with broader testing underway across additional domains. Together, these results mark a practical step toward deployable, general-purpose Physical AI."
