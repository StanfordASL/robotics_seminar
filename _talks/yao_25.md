title: "Embodied Intelligence with Morphing Materials and Mechanisms"
abstract: "Robotists face many open design challenges, such as complete degradability and biocompatibility, arbitrary shape morphing, and freely reconfigurable degrees of freedom. In this talk, I will present that addressing these challenges sometimes requires looking beyond conventional mechatronic systems. I will present several examples, ranging from purely passive, material-driven field “robots” to material-mechanism hybrid systems with tunable degrees of freedom. Additionally, I will discuss the critical role of computational design and optimization in assisting robotic and machine design and control. Through these examples, I hope to share the perspective that, when designed and engineered strategically, morphing materials and mechanisms can empower machines with embodied intelligence."
