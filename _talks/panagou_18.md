title: Persistent Coverage Control for Constrained Multi-UAV Systems
abstract: "Control of multi-agent systems and networks has been a popular topic of research with applications in numerous real-world problems involving autonomous unmanned vehicles (ground, marine, aerial, space) and robotic assets. Despite the significant progress over the past few years, we are not yet in place to deploy arbitrarily large-scale systems with prescribed safety and resilience (against malfunction or malicious attacks) guarantees for a variety of applications, such as surveillance and situational awareness in civilian and military environments. Planning, estimation and control for such complex systems is challenging due to non-trivial agent (vehicle, robot) dynamics, restrictions in onboard power, sensing, computation and communication resources, the number of agents in the network, and uncertainty about the environment. In this talk, we will present some of our recent results and ongoing work on the safe, persistent dynamic coverage control for multi-UAS networks."
