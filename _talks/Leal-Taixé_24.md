title: "Open-world Segmentation and Tracking in 3D"
abstract: "In this talk, I will discuss how to train models for detection and segmentation of 3D data, e.g., Lidar,  without having to actually annotate data in the 3D domain. I will discuss different uses of pseudo-labels and present a demo for our Segment Anything in Lidar."
youtube-code: "TBD"
