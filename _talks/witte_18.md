title: Assistance of Walking and Running Using Wearable Robots
abstract: "We are familiar with wearable robots through comic books and movies. Exoskeletons give heroes such as Iron Man enhanced strength, speed, and ability. While we are far from reaching super human abilities in reality, exoskeletons are hitting the consumer market as tools for rehabilitation and assisting assembly line workers. Exoskeleton research has progressed significantly in the last several years, but it is still difficult to determine how exoskeleton assistance should be adapted to fit the needs of individuals. I present an approach to this problem that utilizes a highly adaptable experimental setup called an exoskeleton emulator system to rapidly explore exoskeleton design and control strategies. I will introduce human-in-the-loop optimization which is utilized for selecting the optimal settings for each user. I will also present the latest results for exoskeleton assisted walking and running using these tools and my thoughts on the future of exoskeleton technologies."
