title: How to Make, Sense, and Make Sense of Contact in Robotic Manipulation
abstract: "Reach into your pocket, grab one object (phone) between others (keys, wallet), and take it out. Congratulations, you have achieved an impressive feat of motor control, one that we can not replicate in artificial mechanisms. What was the key to success: the mechanical structure of the hand, the rich tactile and proprioceptive data it can collect, analysis and planning in the brain, or perhaps all of these? In this talk, I will present our work advancing each of these areas: analytical models of grasp stability (with realistic contact and non-convex energy dissipation constraints), design and use of sensors (tactile and proprioceptive) for contact information, and hand posture subspaces (for mechanism design optimization and teleoperation). These are stepping stones towards motor skills which rely on transient contact with complex environments (such as dexterous manipulation), motivated by applications as diverse as logistics, manufacturing, disaster response and space robots."
